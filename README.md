#### Features

- Use any model from [OpenAI](), [Anthropic](), [Cohere](), [Forefront](), [HuggingFace](), [Aleph Alpha](), and [llama.cpp]().
- Full playground UI, including history, parameter tuning, keyboard shortcuts, and logprops.
- Compare models side-by-side with the same prompt, individually tune model parameters, and retry with different paramaters.
- Automatically detects local models in your HuggingFace cache, and lets you install new ones.
- Works OK on your phone.
- Probably won't kill everyone.

## Try on nat.dev

Try the free hosted version: [nat.dev](https://nat.dev).

## How to install and run

```sh

$ openplayground run
```

## How to run for development

```sh

$ cd app && npx parcel watch src/index.html --no-cache
$ cd server && flask run --debug -p $PORT
```

## Ideas for contributions

- Add tests ðŸ˜…
- Setup automatic builds with GitHub Actions
- The default parameters for each model are configured in the `server/models.json` file. If you find better default parameters for a model, please submit a pull request!
- Someone can help us make a homebrew package, and a dockerfile
- Easier way to install open source models directly from openplayground, with `openplayground install <model>` or in the UI.
- Find and fix bugs
- ChatGPT UI, with turn-by-turn, markdown rendering, chatgpt plugin support, etc.
- We will probably need multimodal inputs and outputs at some point in 2023
