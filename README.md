# openplayground

An LLM playground you can run on your laptop.

#### Features

- Use any model from [OpenAI](), [Anthropic](), [Cohere](), [Forefront](), [HuggingFace](), [Aleph Alpha](), and [llama.cpp]().
- Full playground UI, including history, parameter tuning, keyboard shortcuts, and logprops.
- Compare models side-by-side with the same prompt, individually tune model parameters, and retry with different paramaters.
- Automatically detects local models in your HuggingFace cache, and lets you install new ones.
- Works OK on your phone.
- Probably won't kill everyone.

## Try on nat.dev

Try the free hosted version: [nat.dev](https://nat.dev).

## How to install and run

```sh
$ pip install openplayground
$ openplayground run
```

## How to run for development

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/nat/openplayground
$ cd app && npx parcel watch src/index.html --no-cache
$ cd server && flask run --debug -p $PORT
```

## Ideas for contributions

- Add tests ðŸ˜…
- Setup automatic builds with GitHub Actions
- The default parameters for each model are configured in the `server/models.json` file. If you find better default parameters for a model, please submit a pull request!
- Someone can help us make a homebrew package, and a dockerfile
- Easier way to install open source models directly from openplayground, with `openplayground install <model>` or in the UI.
- Find and fix bugs
- ChatGPT UI, with turn-by-turn, markdown rendering, chatgpt plugin support, etc.
- We will probably need multimodal inputs and outputs at some point in 2023

### Adding models to openplayground 

Models and providers have three types in openplayground:
+ Searchable
+ Local inference
+ API

You can add models in `server/models.json` with the following schema:

#### Local inference

For models running locally on your device you can add them to openplayground like the following (a minimal example):
```json
"llama": {
        "api_key" : false,
        "models" : {
            "llama-70b": {
                "parameters": {
                    "temperature": {
                        "value": 0.5,
                        "range": [
                            0.1,
                            1.0
                        ]
                    },
                }
            }
        }
}
```

Keep in mind you will need to add a generation method for your model in `server/app.py`. Take a look at `local_text_generation()` as an example.

#### API Provider Inference

This is for model providers like OpenAI, cohere, forefront, and more. You can connect them easily into openplayground (a minimal example):
```json
"cohere": {
        "api_key" : true,
        "models" : {
            "xlarge": {
                "parameters": {
                    "temperature": {
                        "value": 0.5,
                        "range": [
                            0.1,
                            1.0
                        ]
                    },
                }
            }
        }
}
```

Keep in mind you will need to add a generation method for your model in `server/app.py`. Take a look at `openai_text_generation()` or `cohere_text_generation()` as an example.

#### Searchable models

We use this for Huggingface Remote Inference models, the search endpoint is useful for scaling to N models in the settings page.

```json
"provider_name": {
        "api_key": true,
        "search": {
            "endpoint": "ENDPOINT_URL"
        },
        "parameters": {
            "parameter": {
                "value": 1.0,
                "range": [
                    0.1,
                    1.0
                ]
            },
        }
}
```
