## Ideas for contributions

- Add tests ðŸ˜…
- Setup automatic builds with GitHub Actions
- The default parameters for each model are configured in the `server/models.json` file. If you find better default parameters for a model, please submit a pull request!
- Someone can help us make a homebrew package, and a dockerfile
- Easier way to install open source models directly from openplayground, with `openplayground install <model>` or in the UI.
- Find and fix bugs
- ChatGPT UI, with turn-by-turn, markdown rendering, chatgpt plugin support, etc.
- We will probably need multimodal inputs and outputs at some point in 2023
