- Compare screen where you run run test models against the same prompt simultaneously, individually tune model parameters, the try same model multiple times with different paramaters
- Automatically detects local models in your HuggingFace cache, lets you install new ones
- Works ok on phone
- Probably won't kill everyone

## Ideas for contributions

- Add tests ðŸ˜…
- Setup automatic builds with GitHub Actions
- The default parameters for each model are configured in the `server/models.json` file. If you find better default parameters for a model, please submit a pull request!
- Someone can help us make a homebrew package, and a dockerfile
- Easier way to install open source models directly from openplayground, with `openplayground install <model>` or in the UI.
- Find and fix bugs
- ChatGPT UI, with turn-by-turn, markdown rendering, chatgpt plugin support, etc.
- We will probably need multimodal inputs and outputs at some point in 2023
